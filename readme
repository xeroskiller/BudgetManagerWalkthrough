This is a learning attempt.
My goal is to create a BudgetManager following this guide:

https://codeburst.io/building-a-budget-manager-with-vue-js-and-node-js-part-i-f3d7311822a8

and I figured it'd be best to have a github repo.
MIT or whatever.

The following dependencies are used:
    Express
        Framework for NodeJS to facilitate API dev
    Body Parser
        Body parsing middleware
    Mongoose
        Async backend
    Consign
        Autoloads
    Bcrypt
        Salt and Hash
    Morgan
        Request logger middleware
    Module Alias    
        Something about module paths
